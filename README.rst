Usage and Installation
----------------------

Tox loads all plugins automatically. To use tox-docker, ``pip install`` it
into the same Python environment as you install tox into, whether that's a
virtualenv, etc.

You do not need to do anything special when running tox to invoke
tox-docker, however you do need to configure your project to configure
docker containers (see "Configuration" below).

Configuration
-------------

Each docker container you want to run must be configured via a
``[docker:container-name]`` section. The ``container-name`` is a name you
choose which must start with a letter and consist of only letters, numbers,
dots, hyphens, and underscores. Each ``[docker:container-name]`` section must
contain at least an ``image`` directive, which must name a `Docker image
<https://docs.docker.com/glossary/#image>`__ as you'd pass to ``docker run``::

    [docker:db]
    image = postgres:9-alpine

Then, in your ``[testenv]``, use the ``docker`` directive to list containers
you wish to run during those tests::

    [testenv]
    docker =
        db
    commands = ...

The ``[docker:container-name]`` section may contain the following directives:

``image`` (required)
    The `Docker image <https://docs.docker.com/glossary/#image>`__ to run.
    This value is passed directly to Docker, and may be of any of the forms
    that Docker accepts in eg ``docker run``.

``environment``
    A multi-line list of ``KEY=value`` settings which is used to set
    environment variables for the container. The variables are only available
    to the container, not to other containers or the test environment.

``ports``
    A multi-line list of port mapping specifications, as
    ``HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT/PROTO``, which causes the container's
    ``EXPOSE`` d port to be available on ``HOST_PORT``. See below for
    more on port mapping.

    If ``ports`` is not specified, all the container's ``EXPOSE`` d ports are
    mapped (equivalent to ``docker run -P ...``)

    For each mapped port, an environment variable of the form
    ``<container-name>_<port-number>_<protocol>_PORT`` (eg
    ``NGINX_80_TCP_PORT`` or ``TELEGRAF_8092_UDP_PORT``) is set for the test
    run.

    For each container, an environment variable of the form
    ``<container_name>_HOST`` is set for the test run, indicating the host
    name or IP address to use to communicate with the container.

    In both environment variables, the container name part is converted to
    upper case, and all non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with an
    underscore (``_``).

    Tox-docker does not attempt to ensure that you have proper permission to
    bind the ``HOST_PORT``, that it is not already bound and listening, etc;
    if you explicitly list ports, it is your responsibility to ensure that
    it can be successfully mapped.

``links``
    A multi-line list of `container links
    <https://docs.docker.com/network/links/>`__, as ``other-container-name``
    or ``other-container-name:alias``. If no alias is given, the
    ``other-container-name`` is used. Within the container, the ``EXPOSE`` d
    ports of the other container will be available via the alias as hostname.

    When using links, you must specify containers in the correct start order
    in the ``docker`` directive of your testenv -- tox-docker does not attempt
    to resolve a valid start order.

``volumes``
    A multi-line list of `volumes
    <https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/>`__ to make available to the
    container, as ``<type>:<options>:<outside_path_or_name>:<inside_path>``.
    The ``type`` must be ``bind``, and the only supported options are ``rw``
    (read-write) or ``ro`` (read-only). The ``outside_path_or_name`` must
    be a path that exists on the host system. Both the ``outside_path``
    and ``inside_path`` must be absolute paths.

``healthcheck_cmd``, ``healthcheck_interval``, ``healthcheck_retries``, ``healthcheck_start_period``, ``healthcheck_timeout``
    These set or customize parameters of the container `health check
    <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck>`__. The
    ``healthcheck_interval``, ``healthcheck_start_period``, and
    ``healthcheck_timeout`` are specified as a number of seconds.
    The ``healtcheck_cmd`` is an argv list which must name a command and
    arguments that can be run within the container; if not specified, any
    health check built in to the container is used.

    If any healthcheck parameters are defined, tox-docker will delay the
    test run until the container reports healthy, and will fail the test
    run if it never does so (within the parameters specified).

Command-Line Arguments
----------------------

All Docker container configuration is specified in ``tox.ini``, but some
aspects of tox-docker's behavior can be changed at run-time:

``--docker-dont-stop=CONTAINER``
    After the test run, don't stop & remove the named ``CONTAINER`` --
    leaving the container running allows manual inspection of it, eg via
    ``docker exec ...``. May be specified multiple times to leave several
    containers running.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: ini

    [testenv:integration-tests]
    deps = pytest
    commands = py.test {toxinidir}/tests
    docker =
        db
        appserv

    [docker:db]
    image = postgres:11-alpine
    # Environment variables are passed to the container. They are only
    # available to that container, and not to the testenv, other
    # containers, or as replacements in other parts of tox.ini
    environment =
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD=hunter2
        POSTGRES_USER=dbuser
        POSTGRES_DB=tox_test_db
    # The healthcheck ensures that tox-docker won't run tests until the
    # container is up and the command finishes with exit code 0 (success)
    healthcheck_cmd = PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD psql \
        --user=$POSTGRES_USER --dbname=$POSTGRES_DB \
        --host=127.0.0.1 --quiet --no-align --tuples-only \
        -1 --command="SELECT 1"
    healthcheck_timeout = 1
    healthcheck_retries = 30
    healthcheck_interval = 1
    healthcheck_start_period = 1
    # Configure a bind-mounted volume on the host to store Postgres' data
    # NOTE: this is included for demonstration purposes of tox-docker's
    # volume capability; you probably _don't_ want to do this for real
    # testing use cases, as this could persist data between test runs
    volumes =
        bind:rw:/my/own/datadir:/var/lib/postgresql/data

    [docker:appserv]
    # You can use any value that `docker run` would accept as the image
    image = your-registry.example.org:1234/your-appserv
    # Within the appserv container, host "db" is linked to the postgres container
    links =
        db:db
    # Use ports to expose specific ports; if you don't specify ports, then all
    # the EXPOSEd ports defined by the image are mapped to an available
    # ephemeral port.
    ports =
        8080:8080/tcp


Environment Variables
---------------------

If you are running in a Docker-In-Docker environment, you can override the address
used for port checking using the environment variable ``TOX_DOCKER_GATEWAY``. This
variable should be the hostname or ip address used to connect to the container.

Version Compatibility
---------------------

Tox-docker requires tox to be run in Python 3.6 or newer, and requires tox
version 3.0 or newer. Older versions of tox-docker may work with older
versions of Python or tox, but these configurations are no longer supported.


==========
Change Log
==========

* 3.0.0
    * Support Tox 3 and newer only
    * Automatically cleans up started docker containers, even if Tox
      encounters an error during the test run (thanks @d9pouces)
* 2.0.0
    * Support Python 3.6 and newer only
    * Move all container configuration to ``[docker:container-name]``
      sections
    * Don't infer container health by pinging TCP ports; only the
      healthcheck indicates a container's health

Code Style
----------

Tox-docker uses black and isort to enforce style standards on the codebase.
The formatting is orindaily done for you via `pre-commit
<https://pre-commit.com/>`_, and is enforced via the ``tox -e style`` build.
To work on tox-docker locally with pre-commit, `pip install -r
dev-requirements.txt`` and ``pre-commit install`` to set up the git hooks;
subsequently, when you ``git commit``, the formatter will be run. If the
changed files are not conformant, the hook will have reformatted them and
you may need to run pre-commit again. You can run ``pre-commit run --files
*.py`` to manually run the formatters.
