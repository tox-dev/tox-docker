    A new ``skip_port_validation`` flag is added. This can be used to disable
    port scanning for created instances and is useful for images that provide
    optional port. It can be configured for each image in a ``[docker:IMAGE]``
    section. For example::

        [docker:mysql:8.0]
        skip_port_validation = True
